An article published in \"Drone Drones\" magazine describes how a drone can be used to send contraband into a secure facility.\nThis is possible because drones are capable of flying at high altitudes, which means they can fly into prison windows. Drone technology is advanced enough that it can light cameras, cups of coffee, and even fresh-baked cookies to prison windows through windows. While there are examples of drones delivering meals to prisons, this is exceptional. While a flat screen can be flown through the air as easy as a pizza, bringing cups of coffee and a slice of pizza through a window is the highest success rate.
